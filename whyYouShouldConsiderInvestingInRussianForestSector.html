            <p class="t-article t-article-first">
            According to the FORECAST OF FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION TILL 2030, prepared by the UN, potential of forest sector in Russia is huge and represents an attractive area for investments.
            <br/>
            Russia has over 20% of the world's forests, but its share in world timber trade is only 4%. At the same time, more than half of exports goes to roundwood and sawnwood (54%). Forests occupy more than half of the country's territory, however, the share of the forest sector in GDP is only 1.3%, in industrial production - 3.7%, in employment - 1%, and in the export earnings - 2.4%.
            <br/>
            All these facts indicate that the forest potential in Russia is underutilized. The opportunities and prospects of the forest sector are underestimated by the economics policy of the country and the forest sector itself is not a priority of the national economic policy.
            </p>


            <div class="t-article-box">
              Problems associated with development of Russian forest sector:
                <ul>
                  <li>inefficient forest management system</li>
                  <li>high depreciation of fixed assets</li>
                  <li>imperfect mechanisms of distribution and expenditure of subventions</li>
                  <li>lack of developed infrastructure</li>
                  <li>"gray" and "black" logging schemes</li>
                  <li>seasonality</li>
                  <li>high cost of services in energy and logistics</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

              <p class="t-article">
            Listed problems are systematic and require changes in the whole management system and should be considered in very beginning. But the most urgent problem in current conditions is insufficient level of investments in forest sector. Currently internal investments directed to forestry don’t contribute to modernization, industry requires increasing investments approximately 2-3 times for future development. Foreign companies interested in investments in Russia can become potential investors.
            <br/>
            The industry is still unattractive, and especially for foreign investors due to a complex of problems associated with instability and risks. Performance of existing logging enterprises are often not positive. Due to the transport inaccessibility of a large number of forest areas in the country, there are no conditions for the full development of the estimated cutting area, and this is a deterrent factor for the development of the timber industry complex. Investments in wood processing are more profitable for regions with developed network of roads.
            <br/>
            The share of logging and exportation to the world market has significantly decreased: If 15 years ago in logging industry and export to the world market Russia took the second place, for today is only the 9th. In this regard, the government began actively to attract investment.
            The main task of Russian government was to increase the investment attractiveness of the timber industry complex. The New Forest Code and program of privileges and preferences for investors - the main measures to create favourable conditions for investments. The main incentive for increasing investments in the industry are state guarantees, at present a system is being developed to ensure the stability of conditions and rules of interaction in the forestry complex.
            <br/>

            <div class="t-article-box">
            But why you still should consider investing in Russian forest sector:
              <ul>
                <li>attractive price of resources, energy and labour</li>
                <li>attractive investment conditions</li>
                <li>state support for priority projects</li>
                <li>tax reduction policy</li>
                <li>initial level of industry development</li>
                <li>potential product market</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p class="t-article">
            One promising approach is promotion of investment projects in the timber industry. Measures of the state are fixed by RF Government Decree of 30 June 2007 "On priority investment projects in forest exploitation". Priority projects may include investment volume of at least 300 million RUB (~43 million EUR). At the same time, the project should be profitable with an optimal payback period. It is also important for the state that the forest plots leased for projects are used as efficiently as possible, and the enterprises will contribute financially to the country's budget in the form of taxes and rents. To implement priority investment projects, the state provides entrepreneurs with non-tax incentives.
            <br/>
            One example can show significant growth and lead other sectors of the forest industry is production of wood materials, including plywood, as well as fuel pellets, currently internal market requires wood products with special properties. In this direction potential investors can see perspectives.
            <br/>
            In general, new developments in wood materials production is perspective direction. Russian goverment defines measures to support priority investment projects are aimed at stimulating integrated processing of wood, with an emphasis on the development of bioenergy. This direction has very good prospects and should also become one of the drivers for the development of the forestry sector of the Russian economy.
